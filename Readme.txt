Before running the script make sure all required environment variables are set. To run the script, run the following in command line:

$./myScript.sh Video-to-Mp3-converter_v1.0.apk screenshot.png

The first argument is the name of the apk file present in the myScript folder and the second argument is the name of the image by which the scrrenshot needs to be saved in the same folder.

The script is not general in total because of the fact that I didn't grabbed the package name and the launchable activity. Instead I did it manually. In the next version I would improve upon it.
